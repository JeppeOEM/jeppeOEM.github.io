In an era where node_modules folders resemble digital black holes, I decided to take a step back for my personal portfolio site. Instead of relying on big, powerful frameworks and constantly shifting dependencies, I built it as an old-school static website using nothing but vanilla JavaScript.

I keep my page and code simple for the same reason I’m drawn to ANSI art and the aestethics of Bulltentin Board Systemts's of —because there’s a quiet elegance in shaping something expressive from almost nothing.”


The site is also a playground where I experiment with combining ANSI art with CSS animations. Since ANSI isn’t naturally compatible with the web, and every ANSI to HTML converter I’ve tried does a poor job in regards to making it easy to animate with CSS, i hope to find a more optimal way of converting ANSI to HTML and build it.

It’s very much a work in progress—a small labor of love with a backlog of bugs and ideas that I’m still working through, but a minimal viable product is ready to be shown.
