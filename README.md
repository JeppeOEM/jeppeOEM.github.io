In an era where node_modules folders resemble digital black holes, I decided to take a step back for my personal portfolio site. Instead of relying on big, powerful frameworks and constantly shifting dependencies, I built it as an old-school static website using nothing but vanilla JavaScript.

I keep my page and code simple for the same reason I’m drawn to ANSI art and the aestethics of Bulltentin Board Systemts's of —because there’s a quiet elegance in shaping something expressive from almost nothing.”


The site is also a kind of personal playground where I experiment with bringing ANSI art into HTML. Since ANSI isn’t naturally compatible with the web, and every converter I’ve tried does a poor job, I ended up creating all the ANSI graphics myself. Along the way, I’m also using the project to sharpen my CSS animation skills.

It’s very much a work in progress—a small labor of love with a growing backlog of bugs and ideas that I’m still working through—but that’s part of the fun.
