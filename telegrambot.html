        <h1>Description</h1>

          <p>The goal of this project was to interact with the Binance Blockchain using the Web3py framework to be able buy and sell newly created cryptocurrencies in the cloud.<br><br> 
          The method is to collect data about newly created currencies, which is posted on Telegram channels that only contain that. <br>
          That data is then processed and with automation posted on honeypot.is to check if itâ€™s a scam token, the result is then webscrapped, and the bot can buy the token and follows its price until it sells it again.<br>
         <a href="">The whole process is Illustrated here in a activity diagram.</a> </p> 
          <h1> Challenges:</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To ensure that the bot is selling all the tokens I bhought I had to look inside large chuncks of metadata convert it to JSON and extract the information from the nested json objects and then convert it from hexadecimals to decimals.
            </li>
            <li>
              To be able to get the token address and post it on honeypot.is to check if it is a scam,
            </li>
            <li>
              To be able to run the bot on Heroku while using browserless chrome I found out that adding buildpacks with links to github repositories the drivers would be installed in the cloud.
          
            </li>

          </ul>


         
         <h1>Improvements:</h1> 
         <p>
          The project is a minimal viable product and was just an attempt to make a starting point from where I can build on the code to make different trading bots and other application interacting with a blockchain.
          The whlAs I do not dare to run this 
         </p>

          


<!--             A minimal viable product of a cryptocurrency trading bot which uses Web3py to send transactions and receive price data directly 
            from the "Binance Smart Chain".   <br> This is first step in a larger an ongoing project  <br><br>
            The logic behind is to listen to a Telegram Channel that only post information on newly created Cryptocurrencies, and then buy these coins if certain criteria are met forexample size of liquidity pool.<br>
            One feature is a scam check that uses selenium to post the token address on a website and then web scrape the result.<br>
            If that test is passed the bot does a test buy and sell, if that is a succes.
            The token will be purchased and the transaction data will be stored in a sql database. 
            The bot will then every few seconds get new price information from an endpoint until a predetermined 
            sell price is achived. 
            The bot has been made ready for deployment on Heroku.  -->
